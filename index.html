<h4 class="text-left text-primary" style="display: block;">I am an assistant professor in Dept. Computer Science and Software Engineering, directing the <u><a href="http://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/call/index.html">Computational Automated Learning Laboratory</a></u>. My current research focus centers around <u>Trustworthy AI</u> (such as interpretable AI, safe and risk-aware AI, fairness in AI, etc.), <u>Interactive Machine Learning</u> (such as reinforcement learning, human-aided learning), and <u>Neural-Symbolic AI</u> (such as neural-symbolic rule synthesis and analysis). Previously I worked in the Autonomous Learning lab at UMass Amherst, working closely with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mahadeva/">Prof. Sridhar Mahadevan</a> and <a href="http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/~barto/">Prof. Andy Barto</a>. I also worked with Prof. <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/">Rich Sutton</a> in the summer of 2018.
